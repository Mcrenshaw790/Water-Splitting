# General

Directories A - F contain corresponding data for each intermediate/transition state/scan. Within each directory there might be multiple subdirectories for each model chemistry:

`Full_Model` for dimeric model chemistry, `Mono` for monomeric model chemistry and `Me_Mono` for monomeric model chemistry with simplified ligand model. If only one model chemistry was used, the directory will simply contain the corresponding files.

For each structure there a typically files corresponding to two or three different calculations (DFT calculations):

1. Geometry optimization and frequency calculation, designated by `-GPOF` file name (or `-GPF` if file contains only the frequency calculation)

2.
