# Overview

This repository contains original data and analysis code for "Final Title (two photon water splitting".

`Computational_Data` contains computational data for all computed intermediates (typically .log files and visualizations)

`Data_Analysis` contains the different Python programs used for data analysis. Note that these programs use various files from `Computational_Data` as well as `Experimental_Data`, hence these directory must be present to run most of them.

`Documents` contains formatted documents such as the supporting information.

`Experimental_Data` contains various experimental data, especially spectroscopy and kinetic data as well Excel sheets used for small calculations on experimental data.

`Figures` contains figures that appear in either the manuscript or supporting information (typically as .pdf files)
