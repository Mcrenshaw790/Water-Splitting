# General

This directory contains all Python programs used for data analysis. Most programs depend on each other and import code from other modules, so that for easy use, all programs should be present to run data analysis.

Overview of contents:

Name | Contents
--- | ---
`Absorption_Spectrum_to_Dual_Irradiation.py` | Code to convert theoretical UV/Vis Spectra to predicted dual irradiation behaviour
`Controlled_Average.py` | Module to average sub-sets of data so that intervals between to data sets are identical
`Decay_Associated_Spectra.py` | Code to visualize experimental DAS and to compute theoretical DAS from UV/Vis spectra
`Figures.py` | Code to generate final figures
`find_nearest.py` | Module to find index of value closest to provided one in an array
`Free_Energy_Profile.py` | Code for visualization of free energy profile and conical intersections plot
`Gas_Phase_O2_Analysis.py` | Code for gas phase O<sub>2</sub> analysis
